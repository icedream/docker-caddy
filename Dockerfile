# I would have run "setcap cap_net_bind_service=+ep /usr/local/bin/caddy" as well but it will not work in Docker
# thanks to inconsistencies with aufs and kernel settings on Ubuntu.
#
# My recommendation is to let Caddy bind to a non-root port instead and use the Docker userland proxy if possible,
# so for example binding Caddy to port 2200 and telling Docker to forward port 80 to port 2200 in the container
# should be just fine.
